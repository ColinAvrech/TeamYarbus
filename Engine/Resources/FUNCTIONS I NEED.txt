Particle Emitters
-Create a new emitter
-Add emitter as a component to a gameobject
-Emit Rate
-Particle Texture
-Particle fading
-Particle Color
-Particle Initial Velocity
-Particle Acceleration
-Particle Lifetime

GameObjects
-Create a new Gameobject
-Change Transform Properties
-Add component
-Change name
-Find object by name
-Access components on the gameobject (Find component by name?)
-Add Zilch Component
-Destroy Gameobject
-Remove Component

Serialization
-Find File   //not necessary, load can create a new file if it doesn't exist.
-Load File
-Write File
-Read File   //not necessary

I want to be able to save out gameobjects and scenes to whatever data file I want.

Thermodynamics
-Set temperature of a spot on the grid //
-Set density of a spot on the grid     // All interactions should be through an object (e.g Heat emitter component)
-Apply forces within the grid          // Direct access to the grid would likely break things.

Physics
-Apply force or set linear velocity
-Apply torque                                      //Our engine doesn't support torque yet
-Change object to be static, dynamic, or kinematic //Done

Game Engine
-Change scene
-Start Game
-Quit Game

Sound
-Play Sound
-Get Microphone input value that I can use to edit things with.
