GLEW
=====================
GLEW was developed by Milan Ikits and Marcelo Magallon. They also perform 
occasional maintainance to make sure that GLEW stays in mint condition. 
Aaron Lefohn, Joe Kniss, and Chris Wyman were the first users and also 
assisted with the design and debugging process. The acronym GLEW 
originates from Aaron Lefohn. Pasi Kärkkäinen identified and fixed 
several problems with GLX and SDL. Nate Robins created the wglinfo 
utility, to which modifications were made by Michael Wimmer.
